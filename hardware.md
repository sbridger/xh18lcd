## Power supply / control
* soft power latch
  * The supply voltage from the battery is switched via a [transistor](/images/latch-transistor.jpg).
  * It feeds the Motor Enable (White wire) 
  * It is activated while pressing the power button.
  * The microcontroller has to set its pin PD7 to HIGH so it stays on when the button is no more pressed
* buck regulator 12V for the needs of the LCD Backlight
* 5V linear regulator for the microcontroller, fed from 12V

## LCD
* Type: [COG-T177MZHS-11](/images/lcd.jpg)
* [Datasheet of similar display](http://www.tecenstar.com/Kindeditor/attached/file/20160112/20160112164723_2158.pdf)
* Resolution: 160x128
* Controller: ST7735S
* Interface: 8-bit parallel

* Backlight can be controlled via PD2 and PD3:
  * one LOW, one HIGH: normal brightness
  * both HIGH: maximum brightness


## Buttons
* Buttons are connected to the pins stated above.
* LOW active
* external pullup resistors
* capacitors for debouncing(?)

## Grip hallsensor
* Rotation state of the grip is detected by [analog hallsensor SS49E](https://sensing.honeywell.com/SS49E-linear-and-angle-sensor-ics)
* [SS49E](/images/hallsensor.jpg) connected to analog input via a RC filter

## Brake Wire
* Unconnected wire tail
